                <p>Lesson 2<br>After several months of having Sir Lee as my teacher in the subject of Media and Information Literacy (MIL), I can say that I have learned a lot, and my knowledge has been enhanced due to his teaching. I gained a clearer understanding of how machines and technology have evolved in our world. For example, "Papyrus" in the pre-industrial age. It was used by Egyptians and Greeks to document and record information before the existence of the paper we know today. As time goes by, people also become more intelligent. That's why they invented the big machine called "Printing press for mass production" capable of printing thousands of newspapers in a short period of time.

                    Moreover, in the Electronic Age, they still use newspapers, as mentioned in the Industrial Age, but the machines used have become smaller, and the process of inputting written information has become easier. During this time, computers were invented, allowing for the quick recording and saving of written information. The last stage is the Information Age, also known as the Digital Age. This is our current era, where learning is considered easier because everything is on the internet or websites. Unlike before when some information could only be found in books, now, with just a click on a cellphone, computer, or laptop, the information we need quickly appears.
                    
                    In summary, ancient tools are still in use today, but they have undergone changes. As time progresses, people accumulate knowledge and create new inventions not only for their benefit but also for others. Furthermore, with the evolution of machines and technology, communication and the transfer of information within the digital world have become easier and faster.<br>-Raymond Lautan</p>

                <p>Lesson 4<br>What I learned from lesson 4 in MIL that Sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar taught is about the media information sources. Media information sources, specifically, are about searching for information. These sources are where we get our news and information. They include newspapers, TV, online news sites, social media, and other platforms that share information with the public. There are three main sources of information: indigenous knowledge, libraries, and the modern tool to gather information on the internet. Indigenous knowledge pertains to the distinct customary knowledge systems and practices that are cultivated, amassed, and transmitted throughout successive generations within particular cultural and ethnic communities. A library is an intentionally chosen assortment of well-arranged information resources usually kept in a physical or virtual location, made available to the general public for reading, research, and borrowing. The internet is a global network of electronically connected computers and gadgets that facilitates communication and information sharing. Users can access a wide range of resources via it, such as web pages, online services, and multimedia files. 

                    Overall, we learned that the understanding of media information sources becomes evident when, for instance, we are seeking information about a current event. Suppose there is a news story circulating on social media regarding a local community issue. In this scenario, we can observe the use of both traditional and modern media information sources. We might first turn to a reputable online news site to get detailed and verified information about the event. Simultaneously, we could consult social media platforms to gauge public reactions and perspectives on the matter. Additionally, let's consider a situation where an individual is interested in learning about sustainable gardening practices. They may tap into indigenous knowledge by consulting elders or community members who possess traditional wisdom about eco-friendly farming methods. To complement this, they might visit a local library to borrow books and resources on sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, the internet can serve as a valuable tool for accessing online forums, articles, and videos that share contemporary insights into environmentally conscious gardening practices.

                <p>Lesson 7<br>What i learned from lesson 7 from MIL that sir Lee Mar Y. Sabugar discussed. That there are opportunities and challenges in media, information and technology. The opportunities that might be experienced in media, information and technology is online shopping because you can buy goods online and it will be delivered to you. The challenges that might be experienced in media, information and technology is privacy invasion and identity theft in which they try to get your information to sell it or make the information of yourself be theirs.

Furthermore, I learned in lesson 7 that there are laws against the abuse and misuse of media and information. This is republic act no. 10175 the cybercrime prevention act of 2012. In this law it covers all the anomalies online which are for example identity theft and data misuse. And also there are many other laws to in the media, information and technology, these are libel, slander, and piracy.<br>- James Paul McDanilo B. Jollado</p>
